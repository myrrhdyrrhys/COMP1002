# COMP1002
Data Structures and Algorithms (Year 1, Semester 2)

A first year unit that introduced me to different types of structures for holding data and algorithms for manipulating data (mostly just sorting algorthms, e.g. quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, etc.), and their representations in Java and Python (although I mostly opted for using Java). Structures began at arrays, stacks and queues, then to lists and trees and eventually to the more complex heaps, graphs and hashtables.

The files in this repository are for the final assessment of the unit which involved making a program to parse in .json or .csv files of trading prices and statistics of cryto-currencies to then manipulate and present the data in useful ways to the user. For more information on how to run the program refer to the README.txt in the repository. The program should explain options as you run it.
